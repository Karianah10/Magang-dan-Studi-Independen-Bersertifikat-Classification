# Data Science Portfolio - Classification of MSIB Applicant's Passing

This is a GitHub repository for my data science portfolio project, which aims to classify the passing status of MSIB applicants using the decision tree classifier C4.5 algorithm. In the preprocessing stage, the feature selection method used is Ridge Regression.

## Project Description  
This project aims to develop a classification model that can predict the passing status of MSIB applicants based on the available attributes. The algorithm used is the decision tree classifier C4.5, known for its ability to generate a decision tree that can be used to make decisions based on input attributes.

In the preprocessing stage, the feature selection method used is Ridge Regression. This method is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data by retaining the features that have significant contributions to the target variable. Ridge Regression utilizes regularization to adjust the feature coefficients, resulting in the most relevant features being retained.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from survey questionnaire. Dataset includes 15 features and 1 target variable that labelled "Lolos" which contain 2 class 1 and 0.

## Project Workflow
The project workflow can be summarized as follows:
1. Business Understanding: Determine Business Objectives, Assess the Situation, and Determine Data Mining Goals.
2. Data Understanding: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into the variables.
3. Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset for training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, performing feature scaling, and and implement a feature selection process.
4. Modelling: Implement the Decision Tree Classifier C4.5 algorithm for classify the passing status of MSIB applicants.
5. Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as confussion matrix.
6. Deployment: Make the documentation in the form of a thesis that contains activities in each stage of data mining.

## Conclusion

In this data science portfolio project, I developed a classification model to predict the passing status of MSIB applicants using the decision tree classifier C4.5 algorithm. The project also involved preprocessing the data with the feature selection method of Ridge Regression.

Overall, this project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, classification modeling, and feature selection. It demonstrates my ability to leverage machine learning algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems.
